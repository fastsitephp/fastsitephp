# This file is used for linting FastSitePHP with the PHP Static Analysis Tool [phpstan]:
#   https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan
#
# To lint the code base:
#     1) Download [phpstan.phar] from:
#        https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan/releases
#     2) Run:
#        php phpstan.phar analyse --level 8 -a autoload.php -c phpstan.neon src > phpstan_results.txt
#
# Currently all code through extensive Unit Testing so most errors need to be excluded
# based phpstan's on strict checking of PHP Code using PHPDoc Comments and expected types.
# For example many php built-in functions will return [false] on failure while phpstan
# assumes they return int|string|etc. FastSitePHP is built around PHP's flexibility
# and is similar to using JavaScript or Python while PHP Static Analysis Tool seem
# to assume code should be more like C# or Java.
#
# Alternative options that have been tested. Just like [phpstan] running these would
# need a lot of config files so currently only [phpstan] is used.
#    https://github.com/vimeo/psalm
#    https://github.com/phan/phan
#
# Simliar to [phpstan] a (*.phar) file would be downloaded and ran.
#    php psalm.phar > psalm_results.txt
#    php phan.phar > phan_results.txt
#
# IMPORTANT - If editing the code base do not fix "errors" based on [phpstan].
# Rather if the related code is fully unit tested then exclude the error in this file.
# If the code is not fully testsed then it should be or it needs to be carefully
# reviewed and manually tested.
