/**
 * UTF-8 Encoding
 *
 * For most PHP sites UTF-8 is the default character set and using this class
 * is not needed. This class is useful for forcing different character sets
 * to UTF-8 prior to JSON or XML encoding.
 *
 * The PHP function [json_encode()] requires UTF-8 prior to encoding,
 * otherwise it will trigger an error:
 *     JSON_ERROR_UTF8 - 'Malformed UTF-8 characters, possibly incorrectly encoded'
 *
 * For example, IBM i-Series Servers use EBCDIC character encoding which
 * correctly translates to UTF-8 for most characters, however it will trigger
 * the error for some characters.
 *
 * Another example is on FastSitePHP's Encryption Unit Tests, an array of binary
 * strings need to be converted to UTF-8 prior to JSON encoding and hashing.
 * Using this for binary data in most situations is not recommended, rather
 * if you are working with binary files or data use binary format directly.
