    /**
     * Get or set an optional pepper value to use when hashing and verifying the
     * password. For Password Hashing, Pepper is different than the Salt as Pepper
     * is a secret value that is shared by all users. Salt is one of the primary
     * security features of Passwords, while Pepper can be used in certain
     * environments to provide an additional layer of security. If used the
     * Pepper value MUST be saved outside of the database where the password hashes
     * are saved and the pepper value must not be shared with end users. While it
     * can provide an additional level of security it comes with significant
     * complexity so using it requires careful consideration.
     *
     * The pepper value must be a hexadecimal string and one can be generated
     * from the [generatePepper()] function.
     *
     * Advantages of Pepper:
     *  - In a highly structured environment where a Developer would not have access
     *    to the database and the DBA would not have access to the source code then
     *    adding pepper limits the number of people would have required shared secrets.
     *  - If a Database is compromised and hashes are stolen but the Application along
     *    with the Pepper is safe then Pepper can used to prevent dictionary attacks.
     *  - Further Reading:
     *    https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/3272/password-hashing-add-salt-pepper-or-is-salt-enough/3701
     *
     * Disadvantages of Pepper:
     *  - The Pepper value can't be changed without requiring all users of the
     *    application to change their password. This can cause a lot of complexity
     *    for managing users of the app. If all password hashes are stolen then
     *    simply requiring users to change their password would likely be enough
     *    for most apps.
     *  - If the Database and Application are on the same server then someone who
     *    obtains Database Access is more likely to get source code access as well
     *    which defeats the purpose of Pepper.
     *  - The algorithms used in this class (bcrypt and Argon2 with proper salt)
     *    are well studied and known to be secure. Pepper only works in specific cases.
     *  - Further Reading:
     *    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16891729/best-practices-salting-peppering-passwords
     *    https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2012/04/properly-salting-passwords-case-against.html
     *
     * Other Option:
     *  - Another option instead of using Pepper would be to encrypt the password
     *    before hashing it or encrypt the hash. This has similar advantages and
     *    disadvantages compared to using pepper.
     *
