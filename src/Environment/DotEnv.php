/**
 * Loads environment variables from a [.env] file into [getenv()] and [$_ENV].
 *
 * This class is a port of the widely used node [dotenv] package so the
 * following syntax is supported:
 *
 *   - Empty lines are skipped
 *   - Lines beginning with # are treated as comments
 *   - Empty values become empty strings ([EMPTY=] becomes {EMPTY: ''})
 *   - Whitespace is trimmed for unquoted values ([FOO= some value ] becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
 *   - Single and double quoted values are escaped ([SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted'] becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
 *   - Double quoted values expand new lines (example: [MULTILINE="new\nline"])
 *
 * This class is minimal like the node pacakage and does not support
 * nested variables, inline shell execution, or advanced validation.
 * If you prefer to use those features then PHP packages [vlucas/phpdotenv]
 * or [symfony/dotenv] are recommended.
 *
 * Because FastSitePHP's DotEnv Class is minimal and has fast performance it can be
 * used for production sites, however itâ€™s a good idea to load it from middleware
 * or controller logic on needed routes rather than loading it for every route.
